# DigitalGraphs.jl

## Overview
DigitalGraphs.jl is a digital computing simulation framework. The package is built around a computing-graph abstraction that can be harnessed to simulate distributed and asynchronous systems such as
algorithm execution on computer clusters or real-time control systems with latencies and delays. 

## Installation
DigitalGraphs.jl is not yet a registered Julia package.  It can be installed using the following Julia Pkg command.
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(PackageSpec(url="https://github.com/plasmo-dev/DigitalGraphs.jl.git"))
```

## Acknowledgements
DigitalGraphs.jl was initially developed at the [Scalable Systems Laboratory](https://zavalab.engr.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
